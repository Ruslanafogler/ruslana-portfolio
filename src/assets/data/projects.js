  'The schedule of La Jolla Country Day High school fluctuates depending on the rotation; different classes and activities occur on different days, and even times for lunches and breaks weren’t easily predictable. The lack of bells and simple means to check the schedule was a daily source of frustration for students and faculty alike. In my highschool sophomore year, I pitched the Torrey Schedule app before representatives of the school administration and San Diego business executives in the Torrey Explorers Fund. Via a beautiful interface, the app would share all the events for a given day and the time before the next event began.',
  'As one of three winners of the pitchfest, I earned $1000 to fund my Javascript frameworks education and Apple Developer membership. After teaching myself application development, troubleshooting, and reaching out to software professionals for eight months over summer and into the school year, I released the app. Currently, over 80% of our school community(student families, teachers, administration members) have downloaded it, and it’s a lasting contribution to the school.'

  'In my highschool sophomore year, I pitched Blend at the Chicago International Housewares Show with my partner Jeramiah Woods. After performing ethnographic research in hair salons, we realized that consumers often felt uncomfortable due to the presence of security cameras. Throughout the year while participating in Design to Open Entrepreneurship Thinking in the Innovation Lab, I brainstormed Blend: a cheap, silicone skin that would encase dome cameras. This way, cameras would remain more hidden to consumers and simultaneously continue scaring off potential burglars. ',
  'At the International Housewares Show, we presented the product before a panel of judges and many other companies. During the conception of Blend, I was also able to learn more about mood board development and other brainstorming strategies by visiting Blink - UX Research & Design in San Diego. Time spent there provided much inspiration for the logo and postcard development.  '
